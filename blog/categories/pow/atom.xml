    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://pow.cx/">POW</a> as a proxy to my local dev server in development. That gives me nice local *.dev domain names. However I&rsquo;ve noticed that it takes 10 seconds to load a singe page in Chrome. Of course, I thought, It does like 80 requests as each asset is served as a separate file in development. But after investigating it a bit more DNS lookup for each request was 3 seconds and for some reasons it was like that for every single http request.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>After looking around turns out that the issue DNS resolver checks my main DNS server first if it knows anything about *.dev domains, if not then it checks the next dns server and so on. Which results in 3 seconds delay.</p>

<p>Solution.
First thing. I had &lsquo;default&rsquo; rule in pow to proxy port 3000 if now specific domains was matched. So I&rsquo;ve added app specific domain I was using for the development -> storyline which gave me storyline.dev</p>

<p>Second. I&rsquo;ve installed <a href="https://github.com/Rodreegez/powder">powder</a></p>

<pre><code>gem install powder
</code></pre>

<p>and used host command to write my domains into the /etc/hosts file</p>

<pre><code>powder host
</code></pre>

<p>after that DNS lookup decreased from 3s to 1ms. Pretty good time saver.</p>
