<p>book by Marshall B. Rosenberg</p>

<p>This is one the best books I&rsquo;ve ever read. I&rsquo;ve read few dozens of self improvement and psychology books, but did not have a clue what this book is talking about. I would recommend it to everyone, including teenagers.</p>

<p>I did a small experiment and after reading each chapter I&rsquo;ve created a summary list of highlights, first as a lesson for me to revisit each chapter and short list I could come back to in the future.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Chapter 1: Giving from the Heart  </h2>

<h3>The Heart of Nonviolent Communication</h3>

<blockquote><p>“What I want in my life is compassion, a flow between myself and others based on a mutual giving from the heart.</p></blockquote>

<p>—Marshall Rosenberg”</p>

<h3>Introduction  </h3>

<blockquote><p>NVC: a way of communicating that leads us to give from the heart.</p></blockquote>

<h3>A Way To Focus Attention  </h3>

<blockquote><p>We perceive relationships in a new light when we use NVC to hear our own deeper needs and those of others.</p>

<p>Let’s shine the light of consciousness on places where we can hope to find what we are seeking.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The NVC Process  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Four components of NVC:</p>

<ol>
<li>observation</li>
<li>feeling</li>
<li>needs</li>
<li>request”</li>
</ol>


<p>Two parts of NVC:</p>

<ol>
<li>expressing honesty through the four components</li>
<li>receiving empathically through the four components”</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h3>Applying NVC In Our Lives And World  </h3>

<h3>Summary  </h3>

<h2>Chapter 2: Communication That Blocks Compassion  </h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<blockquote><p>Do not judge, and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will yourselves be judged &hellip;<br/>
— Holy Bible, Matthew 7:</p>

<p>Certain ways of communicating alienate us from our natural state of compassion</p></blockquote>

<h3>Moralistic Judgments  </h3>

<blockquote><p>In the world of judgments, our concern centers on WHO “IS” WHAT.</p>

<p>Analyses of others are actually expressions of our own needs and values.</p>

<p>Classifying and judging people promote violence.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Making Comparisons  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Comparisons are a form of judgment.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Denial Of Responsibility  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Our language obscures awareness of personal responsibility.</p>

<p>We can replace language that implies lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice.</p>

<p>We are dangerous when we are not conscious of our responsibility for how we behave, think, and feel.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Other Forms Of Life-Alienating Communication  </h3>

<blockquote><p>We can never make people do anything.</p>

<p>Thinking based on “who deserves what” blocks compassionate communication.</p>

<p>Life-alienating communication has deep philosophical and political roots.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Summary  </h3>

<h2>Chapter 3: Observing Without Evaluating  </h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<blockquote><p>“OBSERVE!! There are few things as important, as religious, as that.”<br/>
— Frederick Buechner, minister</p>

<p>When we combine observation with evaluation, people are apt to hear criticism.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Highest Form Of Human Intelligence  </h3>

<h3>Distinguishing Observations From Evaluations  </h3>

<h3>Summary  </h3>

<blockquote><p>“The most arrogant speaker we’ve ever had!”</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 4: Identifying and Expressing Feelings  </h2>

<h3>The Heavy Cost Of Unexpressed Feelings</h3>

<blockquote><p>Expressing our vulnerability can help resolve conflicts.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Feelings Versus Non-Feelings  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Distinguish feelings from thoughts.</p>

<p>Distinguish between WHAT WE FEEL and WHATWE THINK we are.</p>

<p>Distinguish between WHAT WE FEEL and HOW WE THINK others react or behave toward us.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Building A Vocabulary For Feelings  </h3>

<h3>Summary  </h3>

<h2>Chapter 5: Taking Responsibility For Our Feelings</h2>

<blockquote><p>“People are disturbed not by things, but by the view they take of them.”<br/>
—Epictetus</p></blockquote>

<h3>Hearing A Negative Message: Four Options</h3>

<blockquote><p>What others do may be the stimulus of our feelings, but not the cause.</p>

<p>Four options for receiving negative messages:</p>

<ol>
<li>Blaming ourselves</li>
<li>Blaming others</li>
<li>Sensing our own feelings and needs</li>
<li>Sensing others’ feelings and needs</li>
</ol>


<p>Distinguish between giving from the heart and being motivated out of guilt.</p>

<p>Connect your feeling with your need: “I feel &hellip; because I &hellip;”</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Needs At The Roots Of Feelings  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Judgments of others are alienated expressions of our own unmet needs.</p>

<p>If we express our needs, we have a better chance of getting them met.</p>

<ul>
<li>Autonomy</li>
<li>Celebration</li>
<li>Integrity</li>
<li>Interdependence</li>
<li>Spiritual Communion</li>
<li>Physical Nurturance</li>
<li>Play</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Pain Of Expressing Our Needs Versus The Pain Of Not Expressing Our Needs  </h3>

<blockquote><p>If we don’t value our needs, others may not either.</p></blockquote>

<h3>From Emotional Slavery To Emotional Liberation  </h3>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>First stage: Emotional slavery: we see ourselves responsible for others’ feelings.</li>
<li>Second stage: “Obnoxious”: we feel angry; we no longer want to be responsible for others’ feelings.</li>
<li>Third stage: Emotional liberation: we take responsibility for our intentions and actions</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Summary  </h3>

<blockquote><p>“Bring back the stigma of illegitimacy!”</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 6: Requesting That Which Would Enrich Life  </h2>

<h3>Using Positive Action Language</h3>

<blockquote><p>“Use positive language when making requests.”</p>

<p>Making requests in clear, positive, concrete action language reveals what we really want</p>

<p>Vague language contributes to internal confusion.</p>

<p>Depression is the reward we get for being “good.”</p></blockquote>

<h3>Making Requests Consciously  </h3>

<blockquote><p>It may not be clear to the listener what we want them to do when we simply express our feelings.</p>

<p>We are often not conscious of what we are requesting.</p>

<p>Requests unaccompanied by the speaker’s feelings and needs may sound like a demand.</p>

<p>The clearer we are about what we want back, the more likely it is that we’ll get it.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Asking For A Reflection  </h3>

<blockquote><p>To make sure the message we sent is the message that’s received, ask the listener to reflect it back.</p>

<p>Express appreciation when your listener tries to meet your request for a reflection.</p>

<p>Empathize with the listener who doesn’t want to reflect back.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Requesting Honesty  </h3>

<blockquote><p>After we express ourselves vulnerably, we often want to know</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>(a) what the listener is feeling;</li>
<li>(b) what the listener is thinking; or</li>
<li>&copy; whether the listener would be willing to take a particular action.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Making Requests Of A Group  </h3>

<blockquote><p>In a group, much time is wasted when speakers aren’t certain what response they’re wanting back.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Requests Versus Demands  </h3>

<blockquote><p>When the other person hears a demand from us, they see two options: submit or rebel.</p>

<p>How to tell if it’s a demand or a request: Observe what the speaker does if the request is not complied with.</p>

<p>It’s a demand if the speaker then criticizes or judges.</p>

<p>It’s a demand if the speaker then lays a guilt-trip.</p>

<p>It’s a request if the speaker then shows empathy toward the other person’s needs.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Defining Our Objective When Making Requests  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Our objective is a relationship based on honesty and empathy.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Summary  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Sharing Fears About A Best Friend’s Smoking</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 7: Receiving Empathically  </h2>

<blockquote><p>The two parts of NVC: —expressing honestly —receiving empathically</p></blockquote>

<h3>Presence: Don’t Just Do Something, Stand There</h3>

<blockquote><p>Empathy: emptying the mind and listening with our whole being</p>

<p>Ask before offering advice or reassurance.</p>

<p>Intellectual understanding blocks empathy.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Listening For Feelings And Needs  </h3>

<blockquote><p>No matter what others say, we only hear what they are (a) observing, (b) feeling, &copy; needing, and (d) requesting.</p>

<p>Listen to what people are needing rather than what they are thinking about us.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Paraphrasing  </h3>

<blockquote><p>When asking for information, first express our own feelings and needs.</p>

<p>Reflect back messages that are emotionally charged.</p>

<p>Paraphrase only when it contributes to greater compassion and understanding.</p>

<p>Behind intimidating messages are simply people appealing to us to meet their needs.</p>

<p>A difficult message becomes an opportunity to enrich someone’s life.</p>

<p>Paraphrasing saves time.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Sustaining Empathy  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Staying with empathy, we allow speakers to touch deeper levels of themselves.</p>

<p>We know the speaker has received adequate empathy when a. we sense a release of tension, or b. the flow of words comes to a halt.</p></blockquote>

<h3>When Pain Blocks Our Ability To Empathize  </h3>

<blockquote><p>We need empathy to give empathy.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Summary  </h3>

<blockquote><p>A Wife Connects With Her Dying Husband</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 8: The Power of Empathy  </h2>

<h3>Empathy That Heals</h3>

<blockquote><p>Empathy allows us “to reperceive [our] world in a new way and move on.”</p>

<p>“Don’t just do something&hellip; .”</p>

<p>It’s harder to empathize with those who appear to possess more power, status, or resources.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Empathy And The Ability To Be Vulnerable  </h3>

<blockquote><p>The more we empathize with the other party, the safer we feel.</p>

<p>We “say a lot” by listening for other people’s feelings and needs.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Using Empathy To Defuse Danger  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Empathize, rather than put your “but” in the face of an angry person.</p>

<p>When we listen for their feelings and needs, we no longer see people as monsters.</p>

<p>It may be difficult to empathize with those who are closest to us.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Empathy In Hearing Someone&rsquo;s &ldquo; No! &rdquo;  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Empathizing with someone’s “no” protects us from taking it personally.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Empathy To Revive A Lifeless Conversation  </h3>

<blockquote><p>To bring a conversation back to life: interrupt with empathy.</p>

<p>What bores the listener bores the speaker too.</p>

<p>Speakers prefer that listeners interrupt rather than pretend to listen.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Empathy For Silence  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Empathize with silence by listening for the feelings and needs behind it.</p>

<p>Empathy lies in our ability to be present.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Summary  </h3>

<h2>Chapter 9: Connecting Compassionately With Ourselves</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<blockquote><p>The most important use of NVC may be in developing self-compassion.</p>

<p>We use NVC to evaluate ourselves in ways that engender growth rather than self-hatred.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Evaluating Ourselves When We&rsquo;ve Been Less Than Perfect  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Avoid “shoulding” yourself!</p></blockquote>

<h3>Translating Self-Judgments And Inner Demands  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Self-judgments, like all judgments, are tragic expressions of unmet needs.</p></blockquote>

<h3>NVC Mourning  </h3>

<blockquote><p>NVC mourning: connecting with the feelings and unmet needs stimulated by past actions which we now regret.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Self-Forgiveness  </h3>

<blockquote><p>NVC self-forgiveness : connecting with the need we were trying to meet when we took the action which we now regret.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Lesson Of The Polka-Dotted Suit  </h3>

<blockquote><p>We are compassionate with ourselves when we are able to embrace all parts of ourselves and recognize the needs and values expressed by each part.</p></blockquote>

<h3>&ldquo; Don&rsquo;t do anything that isn&rsquo;t play! &rdquo;  </h3>

<blockquote><p>We want to take action out of the desire to contribute to life rather than out of fear, guilt, shame, or obligation.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Translating &ldquo; Have to &rdquo; To &ldquo; Choose to &rdquo;  </h3>

<blockquote><p>With every choice you make, be conscious of what need it serves.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Cultivating Awareness Of The Energy Behind Our Actions  </h3>

<ol>
<li>for money</li>
<li>for approval</li>
<li>to escape punishment</li>
<li>to avoid shame</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>Be conscious of actions motivated by the desire for money or the approval of others, and by fear, shame, or guilt. Know the price you pay for them.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>to avoid guilt</li>
<li>out of duty</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>The most dangerous of all behaviors may consist of doing things “because we’re supposed to.”</p></blockquote>

<h3>Summary  </h3>

<h2>Chapter 10: Expressing Anger Fully  </h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<blockquote><p>Killing people is too superficial.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Distinguishing Stimulus From Cause  </h3>

<blockquote><p>We are never angry because of what others say or do.</p>

<p>To motivate by guilt, mix up stimulus and cause.</p>

<p>The cause of anger lies in our thinking—in thoughts of blame and judgment.</p></blockquote>

<h3>All Anger Has A Life-Serving Core  </h3>

<blockquote><p>When we judge others, we contribute to violence.</p>

<p>Use anger as a wake-up call.</p>

<p>Anger co-opts our energy by diverting it toward punitive actions.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Stimulus Versus Cause: Practical Implications  </h3>

<blockquote><p>When we become aware of our needs, anger gives way to life-serving feelings.</p>

<p>Violence comes from the belief that other people cause our pain and therefore deserve punishment.</p>

<p>We recall four options when hearing a difficult message:
1. Blaming ourselves
2. Blaming others
3. Sensing our own feelings and needs
4. Sensing others’ feelings and needs
Judgments of others contribute to selffulfilling prophecies.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Four Steps To Expressing Anger  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Steps to expressing anger:
1. Stop. Breathe.
2. Identify our judgmental thoughts.
3. Connect with our needs.
4. Express our feelings and unmet needs.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Offering Empathy First  </h3>

<blockquote><p>The more we hear them, the more they’ll hear us.</p>

<p>Stay conscious of the violent thoughts that arise in our minds without judging them.</p>

<p>When we hear the other person’s feelings and needs, we recognize our common humanity.</p>

<p>Our need is for the other person to truly hear our pain.</p>

<p>People do not hear our pain when they believe they are at fault</p></blockquote>

<h3>Taking Our Time  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Practice translating each judgment into an unmet need.</p>

<p>Take your time.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Summary  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Parent And Teen Dialog A Life-Threatening Issue</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 11: The Protective Use Of Force  </h2>

<h3>The Thinking Behind The Use Of Force  </h3>

<blockquote><p>The intention behind the protective use of force is only to protect, not to punish, blame, or condemn.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Types Of Punitive Force  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Fear of corporal punishment obscures children’s awareness of the compassion underlying parental demands.</p>

<p>Punishment also includes judgmental labeling and the withholding of privileges.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Costs Of Punishment  </h3>

<blockquote><p>When we fear punishment, we focus on consequences, not on our own values.<br/>
Fear of punishment diminishes self-esteem and goodwill.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Two Questions That Reveal The Limitations Of Punishment  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Question 1: What do I want this person to do?<br/>
Question 2: What do I want this person’s reasons to be for doing it?</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Protective Use Of Force In Schools  </h3>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<h2>Chapter 12: Liberating Ourselves and Counseling Others  </h2>

<h3>Freeing Ourselves From Old Programming</h3>

<blockquote><p>We can liberate ourselves from cultural conditioning.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Resolving Internal Conflicts  </h3>

<blockquote><p>To be able to hear our own feelings and needs and to empathize with them can free us from depression.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Caring For Our Inner Environment  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Focus on what we want to do rather than what went wrong.</p>

<p>Defuse stress by hearing our own feelings and needs.</p>

<p>Defuse stress by empathizing with others.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Replacing Diagnosis With NVC  </h3>

<blockquote><p>I empathized with clients instead of interpreting them; I revealed myself instead of diagnosing them.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Summary  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Dealing With Resentments And Self-Judgment</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 13: Expressing Appreciation In Nonviolent Communication  </h2>

<h3>The Intention Behind The Appreciation</h3>

<blockquote><p>Compliments are often judgments—however positive—of others.</p>

<p>Express appreciation as a way to celebrate, not to manipulate.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Three Components Of Appreciation  </h3>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>the actions that have contributed to our well-being;</li>
<li>the particular needs of ours that have been fulfilled; and</li>
<li>the pleasureful feelings engendered by the fulfillment of those needs</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h3>Receiving Appreciation  </h3>

<blockquote><p>Receive appreciation without feelings of superiority or false humility.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Hunger For Appreciation  </h3>

<blockquote><p>We tend to notice what’s wrong rather than what’s right.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Overcoming The Reluctance To Express Appreciation  </h3>
