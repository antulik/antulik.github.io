    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you tired of seeing <em>yet another project</em> on github while there are ten others which do exactly the same thing? In this post I suggest we start to diffirentiate our projects.</p>

<p>Projects like <a href="ruby-toolbox.com">Ruby Toolbox</a> make developers life much easiers by categorising gems and what&rsquo;s more important providing popularity information. It is important because developer can make make his own decision why one gem is better than other one.</p>

<p>The first question I&rsquo;m looking answer for in such situation is <strong>how this gem or project on github is different from another one</strong>, almost identical as it seems at first.</p>

<p>I believe every single library should have the first two sections in its readme file:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is it? And how can it make my life better?</li>
<li>How is it different from competitor projects?</li>
</ul>


<p>So when you think your new project is going to change the world and there are none like it in existance. You can save yourself some time and delete it after <em>initial  commit</em>.</p>

<p>Save time for your fellow developers, be honest and tell why we should and shouldn&rsquo;t use your library.</p>
